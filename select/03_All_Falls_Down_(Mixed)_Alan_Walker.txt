What's the trick?
I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could have been
And I know you want it too
All it takes is that one look at you
And I run right back to you
You cross the line
And it is time to say F Ü
What is the point in saying that
When you know how I will react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just do not work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you
And that's that
'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
When it ዶ notwork out for the better
If it just ain't right
And it is time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down
I'll be fine
I will be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I tried staying cold
But you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope
But I still can't let you go
'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever (then whatever, babe)
When it don't work out for the better (for the better)
If it just ain't right
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down (when it all, when it all)
When it all falls down (when it all falls down)
I'll be fine
(Fine, fine, fine) I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
And that's that

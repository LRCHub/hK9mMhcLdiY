So many things to do
But nothing left to lose
I imagined that the world was
bright and so were you
Everything was new
The headwind was so few
I’ve started walking down some
brand-new avenues
Every time
I didn’t feel we had to give
ourselves away
No one thought
There was a price to pay at all
But then all falls down
Now people are lost
And we’ve got no place to
breakout
All falls down
I’m skin and bone
The dice were thrown and you
have gone
So many things to do
But nothing left to lose
I imagined that the world was
bright and so were you
Everything was new
The headwind was so few
I’ve started walking down some
brand-new avenues
Every time
I didn’t feel we had to give
ourselves away

I’ve started walking down some

But then all falls down
Now people are lost
And we’ve got no place to
breakout
All falls down
I’m skin and bone
The dice were thrown and you've
gone
All falls down
(All falls down)
All falls down
I’m skin and bone
The dice were thrown and you
